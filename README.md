## CMV Labs

the CMV playground

CMV Labs is the start of the next generation Configurable Map Viewer. The objective is a light weight but powerful core...

* Stateful models
  * singleton application model
  * layerInfo and widgetInfo models
* Controller and appModel extensions to easily add functionality
* Easy, non-binding layer and widget loading
* Stylus for easy theming and CSS awesomeness
* Layout widgets (make your own with nothing but the right map node id and you're set)
* Application bootstrapping using local dependencies or esri cdn
* Dojo builds using local dependencies or esri cdn

...providing developers with a framework for building out sweet map viewers, and easy configuration for non-devs alike.

In the very early stages. Join in or stay tuned.
